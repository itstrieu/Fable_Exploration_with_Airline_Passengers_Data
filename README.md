# Fable Exploration with Airline Passengers Data
*Status: First Draft Completed*

## Background
I facilitate a small virtual study group where participants take turns presenting on various topics in data science and statistics. Recently, I delivered a presentation on time series forecasting using the popular Airline Passengers dataset. As part of this presentation, I explored the fable package for the first time to understand its features and capabilities.

## Status Details
The forecasting aspect of this presentation needs refinement. There are sections that utilize packages other than fable, which should be re-written to use fable exclusively.

Additionally, I need to document my results and conclusions to prepare for a future part 2 presentation.

Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I continue to refine my work.
